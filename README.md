# MAPREDUCE-101 


## Introduction

MapReduce is a great framework for efficiently processing large volumes and variety of data.  This course builds upon a basic understanding of
MapReduce to give participants a hands on experience working with MapReduce and introduce them to a higher order processing framework for composing their jobs.

The purpose of this project is to help individuals with the following:

* Review the different components, configuration and functionality that can be performed inside of the Hadoop MapReduce framework.
* Be able to launch and execute a MapReduce job.
* Cover basic troubleshooting techniques for MapReduce
* Understand the basic concepts of Apache Crunch for composing MapReduce jobs
* Write and execute a runnable crunch job that implements a full pipeline.

The class builds upon tutorials that are already available to focus on concepts specific to Cerner and how we solve Big Data processing problems.  The **Prerequisites** were 
selected to introduce participants to Hadoop & MapReduce.  Please complete the **Prerequisites** prior to arriving to class.  The content of the course will build upon concepts presented in the **Prerequisites** and participants will be lost or left behind if they have not adequately prepared.

## Prerequisites

The prereqs were selected because they provide a nice introduction to Hadoop's Architecture as well as to the concepts of MapReduce.  They are
self-study courses but some portions can be skipped as they are not relevant to how Cerner is using Hadoop.  Please review each prereq to see which sections
you are expected to perform.

### Udacity & Cloudera

Cloudera offers the first four sections of its training for free on [Udacity](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/training/courses/udacity/mapreduce.html).
All of the sections are useful and should be reviewed by participants.  Participants can pay for the additional sections (at their own expense) but it is not necessary.

The Udacity training focuses on Hadoop's Streaming API and Python for interacting with the cluster.  Currently Cerner typically does not use the Streaming
API or Python for MapReduce processing.  Participants should feel free to attempt the lessons and coding operations but should not be blocked by a lack of knowledge
about Python.

### Big Data University

To compensate Cloudera and Udacity's focus on Python, it is also suggested participants take the Big Data University's
[Introduction to MapReduce Programming](http://bigdatauniversity.com/bdu-wp/bdu-course/introduction-to-mapreduce-programming/).  For this course please audit
the following sections:

* Lesson 1: Introduction to MapReduce
* Lesson 2: MapReduce Programming

Do not attempt *Lesson 3: MapReduce Programming Using BigInsights* as BigInsights is not currently used at Cerner and not relevant to general Hadoop & MapReduce knowledge.
The purpose of Big Data University's course is to introduce participants to the Java APIs that developers will typically be using at Cerner.

Completing the labs is not necessary but participants can feel free to do so if they choose.

### Device Setup

TODO indicate which VM to download and then use.
